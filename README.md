Metric Spike. I was asked to perform user analysis for a company like Microsoft 
designated as Data Analyst Lead and derive certain insights out of it and 
answer the questions asked by different departments. First it was required to 
create the database using dataset provided. Then it was required to perform 
analysis using SQL to answer the below questions:

user finds quality in a product/service.
